# `{chief}`

> **your personal chief of staff**

- Do you, like me, have crippling ADHD?
- Do you need an accountability buddy?
- Do you struggle to keep track of your own todo lists?

The [chief](https://josiahparry.github.io/chief/) package is your very
own personal chief of staff designed to keep track of all of your
\*\*@#&@R.

This package is insprired by my own attempt at using Claude + Notion MCP
as my own personal assistant. It worked exceptionally well! Until it
didn’t. The Notion MCP server [has some
challenges](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server/issues/47#issuecomment-3739384218).

## Installation

``` r
pak::pak("josiahparry/chief")
```

## What does `{chief}` do?

[chief](https://josiahparry.github.io/chief/) is built for talking to AI
agents via the [Model Context Protocol
(MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

I can’t keep track of my own todo list. But I can remember to send a
message here and there. So I talk to Claude like a personal assistant to
manage my todos instead.

Under the hood, it’s a simple CRUD app with a SQLite database, exposed
as an MCP server via [`{mcpr}`](https://github.com/devOpifex/mcpr/)

## Database location

By default, [chief](https://josiahparry.github.io/chief/) creates a
database in your R user directory via
`tools::R_user_dir("chief", "data")`.

Override this by setting the `CHIEF_PATH` environment variable or the
`chief.path` option.

## Basic R usage

While [chief](https://josiahparry.github.io/chief/) is designed for AI
agent interaction, you can use it directly in R:

``` r
library(chief)

# Create a portfolio
folio <- Portfolio$new()

# Add a todo
todo <- new_todo(
  title = "Write documentation",
  priority = 4,
  deadline = as.POSIXct("2026-01-15")
)
folio$add_todo(todo)

# List incomplete todos
folio$list_incomplete()

# Mark complete
folio$mark_complete(todo@id)
```

## Using chief with claude code

Chief works with a local SQLite database. To work with chief from claude
code, first the http server needs to be running in the background.

> \[!NOTE\]
>
> The
> [`mcpr::serve_io()`](https://mcpr.opifex.org/reference/serve_io.html)
> does not yet work well with claude for the time being.

``` bash
R -e "mcpr::serve_http(chief::chief_mcp_server())"
```

Next add the chief MCP server to claude code

``` bash
claude mcp add chief --transport http http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Open a new claude session and now
[chief](https://josiahparry.github.io/chief/) is available to you!

Here’s an example of a conversation I had with claude code using chief

``` R
❯ What can you do with chief mcp tools?

⏺ With the Chief MCP tools, I can help you manage a complete todo list system with the following capabilities:

  Todo Management

  - Create todos with titles, descriptions, priorities (1-5), deadlines, and tags
  - List todos in different ways (all, incomplete only, or completed only)
  - Update todos to modify any fields like title, priority, deadline, or tags
  - Mark todos as complete when you finish tasks
  - Delete todos that are no longer needed
  - Retrieve specific todos by their ID

  Category Organization

  - Create categories to group related todos (like "ricochet", "work", "personal")
  - List all categories to see your organizational structure
  - Update categories to change their title or description
  - Assign todos to categories for better organization

  Use Cases

  - Track project tasks with priorities and deadlines
  - Organize work across multiple projects using categories
  - Set up reminders with deadline dates
  - Tag tasks for easier filtering and search
  - Monitor completed vs incomplete work

  Essentially, it's a full-featured task management system that I can interact with on your behalf - adding tasks, organizing them, marking them complete, and keeping everything structured. Just tell me what you need to track and I can set it up for you!
