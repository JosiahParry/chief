> **your personal chief of staff**

- Do you, like me, have crippling ADHD? 
- Do you need an accountability buddy?
- Do you struggle to keep track of your own todo lists?

The `{chief}` package is your very own personal chief of staff designed to keep track of all of your **@#&@R.

This package is insprired by my own attempt at using Claude + Notion MCP as my own personal assistant. It worked exceptionally well! 
Until it didn't. The Notion MCP server [has some challenges](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server/issues/47#issuecomment-3739384218).

## Installation

```r
pak::pak("josiahparry/chief")
```

## What does `{chief}` do?

`{chief}` is at its core, a very simple CRUD application that stores your data in a small sqlite database. 


However, `{chief}` also can be used as an MCP server via [`{mcpr}`]()


## Using chief with claude code

Chief works with a local SQLite database. To work with chief from claude code, first the http server needs to be running in the background.

::: callout-note
The `mcpr::serve_io()` does not yet work well with claude for the time being.
:::

```bash
R -e "mcpr::serve_http(chief::chief_mcp_server())"
```

Next add the chief MCP server to claude code

```bash
claude mcp add chief --transport http http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

Open a new claude session and now `{chief}` is available to you!

Here's an example of a conversation I had with claude code using chief

❯ What can you do with chief mcp tools?

⏺ With the Chief MCP tools, I can help you manage a complete todo list system with the following capabilities:

  Todo Management

  - Create todos with titles, descriptions, priorities (1-5), deadlines, and tags
  - List todos in different ways (all, incomplete only, or completed only)
  - Update todos to modify any fields like title, priority, deadline, or tags
  - Mark todos as complete when you finish tasks
  - Delete todos that are no longer needed
  - Retrieve specific todos by their ID

  Category Organization

  - Create categories to group related todos (like "ricochet", "work", "personal")
  - List all categories to see your organizational structure
  - Update categories to change their title or description
  - Assign todos to categories for better organization

  Use Cases

  - Track project tasks with priorities and deadlines
  - Organize work across multiple projects using categories
  - Set up reminders with deadline dates
  - Tag tasks for easier filtering and search
  - Monitor completed vs incomplete work

  Essentially, it's a full-featured task management system that I can interact with on your behalf - adding tasks, organizing them, marking them complete, and keeping everything structured. Just tell me what you need to track and I can set it up for you!
